Topics covered : Let's break down flask overview one by one:

What is a Web Framework: A web framework is a pre-built collection of tools, libraries, and patterns that simplifies and standardizes web application development. It provides a structured way to create web applications, handles common tasks like routing, templating, and database interactions, and promotes good coding practices.

How to build a web framework with Flask: Flask is actually a micro web framework for Python, which means it's lightweight and allows developers to choose the components they need. You don't build a web framework with Flask; you use Flask to build web applications. You can, however, create a custom set of extensions, middleware, and functions to extend Flask's capabilities to suit your specific needs.
